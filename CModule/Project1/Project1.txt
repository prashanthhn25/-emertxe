Image Stegnography (LSB):

->Hiding Information

-> file (txt) 
-> transfer
-> store in this carrier (image.bmp) 
-> check for capacity to handle the txt with this .bmp file, if no, then change the .bmp file that is compatible

-> Manipulate LSB bit of each byte 

:: 1 byte from .txt(binary format) and 1 byte from .bmp

eg:  00101011 and 10111111

:: change from the LSB of the bytes of .bmp from MSB(n) of .txt byte
:: next byte LSB of .bmp from next MSB(n-1) of .txt 
i.e 
eg: 00101011 and 10111110
    00101011 	
-> 1byte .txt--> 8 byte .bmp

-> final image is .bmp file which is encrypted format


Decoding::

-->input: encrpt.bmp and other txt file 

header of the .bmp file [first 54 bytes]

::--> copy the header file from actual .bmp file to encrypted file from 54 byte

starting from 55th byte, copy one by one from .txt to LSb

-> transfer the size of .bmp 
eg: .txt is 4byte, then 32 byte in .bmp is changed
--> pass the size of secret file [so 32 is for ]

--> from 86th bit, 



-----------------------------------------------

 Encryption::

1st 54 bytes--> header
next (sizeof(int)= i.e size of file which is int value) * 8 --> reserved for size encrpytion
next bytes --> data encryption till the last byte of .txt file
remaining bytes in actual .bmp is copied as is

pass parameters through command line [-e for encryption]
lsb_steg -e secret.txt image.bmp encrypted.bmp [if not present,
 else create the output encrpt.bmp as default and save in that]


---------------------------------------------
sinfo -->

----------------------------------------------

Decrytion:: encryted.bmp

1st 54 bytes --> not interested ignore
next 32 bytes will give the size --> get the size
for next size*8 bytes, extract the LSbs and get the actual data by merging
rest ignore

./lsb_steg -d encrpted.bmp message.txt [if .txt is not specified, create one and save the output in that]
